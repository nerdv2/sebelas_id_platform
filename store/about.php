<h3>Store Profile</h3>

  <p>Our school is located in BANDUNG, a city where modernity and tradition meets in harmony. Bandung was well known as “Parisj van Java” for its beautiful landscape and nice temperature.</p>

  <p>Our Mayor, Mr. Ridwan Kamil has proclaimed Bandung as a “Smart City” where all of the govenment institutions, including schools, run their activities based on ICT. Besides, he is also concerned about Environmental Issues and really motivated to create a “Green City”. Therefore one of his efforts is instructing the people in the city to plant consumable plants to supply our daily needs. The program called “Urban Farming”. It’s because we live in urban area with very limited farming land.</p>

  <p>In Bandung, almost every institution, including our school has hydrophonic installation. It’s a very popular thing in town. Then, we realize that those institution only produce the vegetables without knowing what they will do next. It leads to the biggest problem which is “How to sell our hydrophonic crops?”</p>

  <p>This website is try to blend two main characteristics of the city to streghten our identity and also made to help people solving the problem, especially in SMKN 11 Bandung. Further, the website will be developed to help the institutions which have hydrophonic installation to market their products.</p>

  <p>This website is open source so other schools or institution can use it freely.</p>
